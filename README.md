ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Marcos Lavarello Cambaceres:

Student of the higher technical degree in computer science, web designer, and jr programmer in Javascript.

My idea is to achieve an independent work project, both from the perspective of a consultation and also from the teaching of computer science, that is, to achieve full growth in the field of programming and web design. I am currently studying to be a computer technician at the National University of General Sarmiento.
  
ðŸ™Œ I am interested in learning about UX/UI design.
